Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about using data, code, and mathematical modeling to understand systems, solve problems, and build tools. I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of science, analytics, and software — and I’m currently expanding my skillset to include full-stack development and intelligent systems.
